Reverse number code and a code with some codition.

# Casual Code Examples

This repository contains two C++ programs that showcase fundamental programming concepts: number categorization based on divisibility, and number reversal.

## Table of Contents

1. [Number Categorization](#number-categorization)
2. [Number Reversal](#number-reversal)

## Number Categorization
**Filename:** `number_categorization.cpp`

### Introduction
This program categorizes a given number based on its divisibility by 3 and 5, assigning labels such as "Good Number," "Bad Number," or "Poor Number."

### How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter an integer.
4. The program will display the category of the entered number.

## Number Reversal
**Filename:** `number_reversal.cpp`

### Introduction
This program reverses a given number using a while loop. It extracts and reorders the digits of the number in reverse order.

### How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter an integer.
4. The program will display the reversed form of the entered number.
